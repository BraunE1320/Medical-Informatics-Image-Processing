# Medical-Informatics-Image-Processing
Processing, segmenting, and analyzing a prostate and head using Matlab

Program to remove table from medical imaging, allow window-level filtering, and auto-segment. Two forms of auto-segmentation were used, radial segmentation starting from the center of the prostate and edge tracing.
Using the radial segmentation, A 3D mesh reconstruction is made using CAT scan images of a head.

The program also uses Hausdorff distance and Dice similarity to determine how similar two images are.
